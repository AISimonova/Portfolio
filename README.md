In this repository, you will find examples and excerpts related to the formatting of work and the testing of mobile and web applications. It includes insights into various projects involving Postman, excerpts from SQL test task solutions, and sample test documentation for corresponding tasks.

**Web Services Testing**:
- **Yandex Routes**: Analysis and visualization of requirements (mind maps, block-chain â€“ Figma, Draw.io), application of test design techniques, identification of equivalence classes and boundary values, creation of test documentation (checklists, test cases, bug reports in YouTrack). Testing of layout, functionality, and application logic, cross-browser testing, response manipulation through Charles for testing new parameters (breakpoints/maplocal).

- **Yandex Showcase**: Working with Apidoc documentation, writing checklists for testing new API functionality (JSON, XML), creating a request library in Postman, Postman testing, bug report documentation (YouTrack), and report writing.

- **Yandex Scooter (including mobile version)**: Analysis and visualization of requirements (mind map, block-chain), application of test design techniques, identification of equivalence classes and boundary values, decision tables, and pairwise testing. Functional, non-functional, cross-browser, and regression testing. Testing of functionality implemented in the frontend using Charles, DevTools. Logging bug reports in YouTrack. Working with SQL queries to the database (Cygwin).

**Mobile Application**:
- **Yandex Metro**: Requirement analysis, writing checklists for changes in the new version's features, and bug reports after testing in an emulator (Android Studio).

- **Working with Yandex Taxi Database via Console**: Composing SQL queries, working with logs (Cygwin).
